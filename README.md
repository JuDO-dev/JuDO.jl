JuDO is a user interface written in Julia, it allows users to enter specifications of an optimal control problem. 
[DynOptInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuDO-dev/DynOptInterface.jl) is the underlying mathematical interface of JuDO.

JuDO can deal with dynamic optimization problem, it is an extension of [JuMP.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev), a package that could solve mathematical optimization problem.
